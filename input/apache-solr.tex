\noindent Apache Solr is the popular, blazing fast open source enterprise search 
platform from the Apache LuceneTM project. Its major features include 
powerful full-text search, hit highlighting, faceted search, near 
real-time indexing, dynamic clustering, database integration, rich 
document (e.g., Word, PDF) handling, and geospatial search. Solr is 
highly reliable, scalable and fault tolerant, providing distributed 
indexing, replication and load-balanced querying, automated failover 
and recovery, centralized configuration and more. Solr powers the 
search and navigation features of many of the world's largest internet 
sites.

Solr is written in Java and runs as a standalone full-text search server 
within a servlet container such as Jetty. Solr uses the Lucene Java 
search library at its core for full-text indexing and search, and has 
REST-like HTTP/XML and JSON APIs that make it easy to use from virtually 
any programming language. Solr's powerful external configuration allows 
it to be tailored to almost any type of application without Java coding, 
and it has an extensive plugin architecture when more advanced 
customization is required.
