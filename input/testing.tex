\section{Project Testing}
Project testing is an investigation conducted to determine the quality of the project and the services
provided by the project. Testing is the process of analyzing a project to detect the differences between
existing and required conditions (that is defects/errors/bugs) and to evaluate the features of the project.
After complete development of the project it is mandatory to test the project.
The main motive of the project testing is to identify whether project is able to meet user requirements or
not. To know the better performance of project we have to develop various Test Cases. Now, designing
good test cases is a complex art. The complexity comes from three sources:
\begin{itemize}
\item Test cases help us discover information. Different types of tests are more effective for
different classes of information.
\item Test cases can be “good” in a variety of ways. No test case will be good in all of them.
\item Our tend to create test cases according to certain testing styles, such as domain testing or
risk-based testing. Good domain tests are different from good risk-based tests.
\end{itemize}
